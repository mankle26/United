                                The first Generation of the Pokémon main game (released in
                                1996/98/99 (JP/US/EU)) was a milestone in gaming
                                and is still popular: the speed-run world record is from 2020.
                                This first generation of Pokémon is also captured in some kaggle
                                data sets and notebooks. However, while these insights are surely
                                interesting, they miss certain points which highlight common general
                                shortcomings in today´s popular Data Science culture. We´d like to
                                discuss these issues in this project and propose criteria to achieve
                                meaningful insights with Data Science, based on a customers´
                                question regarding his Pokemon game:

                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Which is the best starter in Pokémon Generation 1?
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>

                            </p>
                            <h3>Context matters!</h3>
                            <h5>First: Ego-Perspective</h5>
                            <p>
                                Many analyses are structured around the list of Pokémon and their
                                "stats" (Attack, Defense...). Many conclude that Mewtu is the
                                strongest Pokémon because it has the best stats in that regard.
                                However, such-like analyses completely ignore the gameplay, which
                                allows you to conquer the world of Pokémon gradually mostly through
                                success in Pokémon fights. Why is this important?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, if one starts the game and wants to know which Pokémon to use,
                                the advice "Mewtu is the best." does not help much, because it is
                                literally the last Pokémon you can catch in the game. The solution we
                                suggest is to look at those Pokémon which can be owned
                                right from the beginning and compare only those.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Second: Alter-Perspective</h5>
                            <p>
                                Your own Pokémon is still only half of the story. What also matters
                                is which Pokémon you will have to defeat during the game. What does
                                it help if you have one that is super-effective in fights against
                                Ice-Type if those make only 2% of all fights (which is actually the case...)?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For this analysis, we
                                compiled a data set which includes information
                                on every single fight you have to win within the game to evaluate
                                which strategy could be beneficial for the game as a whole.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Applicability matters!</h3>
                            <p>
                                There are different features to evaluate the power of a Pokémon.
                                Two frequently used are their stats (Attack, Defense...) and
                                sometimes their type. While its type always matters to determine
                                the dis-/advantages of a Pokémon in defense, it is also often assumed
                                that this also matters in determining its offensive dis-/advantages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, this is not the case. Many Pokémon can not learn attacks of
                                their type. Of the twelve Bug-Type Pokémon, only five can learn
                                attacks of this type, while three Pokémon which are not of type Bug
                                can. This already shows that reality might be more complicated than a
                                handy data set might suggest.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>
                                When we take all this in account, which is the best starter in Pokemon Generation 1?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, Poison, Flying, Psychic, Normal and Ground are the Top5 Types one encounters
                                during the game.
                                Grass Type Bulbasaur has a disadvantage against two/three of them in defense.
                                Water Type Squirtle has no disadvantage against any of them in defense.
                                Squirtle and quasi-Starter Nidoran♂ can learn attacks of five and nine very different
                                types, compared to four for Charmander and only two for Bulbasaur.
                                which gives the former two considerable advantage later in the game.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Thus, when looking at the type Dis-/Advantages, Squirtle and Nidoran♂ are the best
                                    starters by far!</b> This is also illustrated in the above graphic.
                            </p>
                            <p>And why does this story tell us something about Data Science culture in general?</p>

                            <p>
                                Getting data and analyzing it is not difficult. The real challenge is
                                to look beyond the seemingly smooth and ready-to-use data,
                                understand its context and
                                analyze it with a focus that allows for real world applications and
                                not purely theoretical - and sometimes trivial - conclusions.
                                This could also mean that one concludes that present data is not
                                useful in allowing such insights and that it might be necessary to
                                collect different or extended data. It might be a hassle but just
                                ignoring the shortcomings is no solution.

                                    The main data set "pok_fights" was compiled using the most recent
                                    speedrun of Pokémon Gen 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNG3tkrxVdQ">Video

                                    Every Pokémon fight received one entry/row, containing information
                                    on the opponent Pokémon including name, level, types and moves. These
                                    were collected from www.pokewiki.de and translated to english using

                                    The frequency of each type among these opponents is displayed in the

                                    type, e.g. Dragon Rage) and entered this type in a new variable.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <li>The Starters data:</li>
                                <p>
                                    The above data was then extended for data on the three official starters
                                    and Nidoran♂, which is a Pokémon you can catch after the first fight in
                                    the game and is often used in speedruns instead of one of the starters.
                                    To keep the data comparable, we
                                    decided to drop the first row, the fight
                                    against the game-intern Rival. In this first fight right after picking
                                    a starter, there are no differences between the different starters (
                                    all of them have only normal moves) and this decision therefore did
                                    not disadvantage one of them. We then checked for each of these four
                                    Pokémon which Types they have. In the cases of Charmander and Nidoran♂
                                    their types change when they evolve during the game, which we
                                    included
                                    at the appropriate row. We
                                    then computed for every row whether there are
                                    type-dis-/advantages between the opponent´s type-specific damage dealing
                                    moves and the types of the starters (here only looking at the starters
                                    in a defensive role). This generated a score between 0 and 2 for each
                                    attack-type combination. When taking into account the second type of the
                                    starter these values can even range between 0 and 4 (dis-/advantages
                                    are multiplied).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We then took the maximum of these up to four values (
                                    each Pokémon has up to 4 moves at a time) and stored it. We then
                                    conducted the same procedure the other way round: What moves can the
                                    starter have at which point of the game and how do those affect the
                                    respective opponent? The resulting value was also stored in a new
                                    variable. Finally, we took the difference of these values, subtracting
                                    the maximum disadvantage in defense from the maximum advantage in
                                    offense, resulting in a final score for each starter vis-à-vis each
                                    opponent. These final values can thus range between 0 and 4 again
                                    and can be summed over the course of the game, which
                                    is exactly what is plotted in the above line chart.

                                <li>Crossroads:</li>
                                <p>
                                    There were both literal and figurative crossroads in preparing the data.
                                    At some points in the game there are different ways one could go
                                    without much discrepancy in speed to complete the game (the chosen
                                    criteria for which fights to include in the data). In fact, it may even
                                    depend on the starter which route is the fastest, therefore these
                                    decisions would affect the dis-/advantage values, as one would face
                                    different opponents. But these occasions are rare and can not
                                    change the overall picture. Our decision was to take the route the
                                    above-mentioned speedrun took without taking into account potentially more
                                    beneficial routes for a specific starter.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another decision involved the consideration of type-specific moves.
                                    Nidoking, the final evolution of Nidoran♂ can learn moves of up
                                    to 9 different types. However, it can only "store" 4 moves at a
                                    time. Although Pokémon can unlearn moves of a specific type and
                                    relearn moves of the same type later, it is not possible to teach
                                    just the right moves for the next opponent and re-configure them
                                    afterwards. As this part is quite complicated and different
                                    solutions are possible of when to learn and unlearn each move,
                                    we decided to determine only an "entry-point" at which a starter
                                    can theoretically learn a move of a specific type and kept it as
                                    a constant attribute until the end of the game.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yet another decision involves Nidoran♂. This one is catchable no matter which
                                    "real" starter is chosen at the start. In the above speedrun
                                    the choice is Squirtle as it has profound advantage in the
                                    first few fights and can therefore support Nidoran♂ at that
                                    time until it has grown enough to fight on its own. However,
                                    this choice affects the Pokémon your rival uses,
                                    which you fight several times during the game, therefore this
                                    could also alter Nidoran♂´s score. Nevertheless, we
                                    believe
                                    that the difference is probably +/-3 and therefore regarded it
                                    as nearly irrelevant. We determined Nidoran♂´s value choosing
                                    Squirtle at the beginning, just like the above speedrun did.
